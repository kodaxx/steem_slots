SteemSlots is an experimental game. It is designed to test the steem API for things like transaction detection and steemconnect integration. It is not a gambling game, as you cannot win anything. There are no withdrawal capabilities and credits do no persist once you leave the page.


**How do I create a SteemSlot Account?**

You cannot create an account on SteemSlot, but you can logging with your username and private key created on Steemit.com, using SteemConnect. This is because SteemSlot is built on the decentralised  steem-blockchain. 
SteemConnect is an identity layer on top of the Steem-blockchain that makes accounts secure. SteemConnect requires only your private key when logging in and not your master password.



**What is Steemit?**

Steemit.com is a blockchain-based social media platform where anyone can earn rewards by blogging, posting videos, commenting and interacting with authors. The steem blockchain not only holds earned cryptocurrency tokens called STEEM and STEEM DOLLARS, but also content (article, video, music, pictures etc) created by its users, a system to vote on that content, receive rewards in addition to other features you would find on popular social networking site.

**How to I withdraw my winnings?**

You can't. There are no "winnings", technically. Again, this game is only made so I could experiment with interacting with the Steem blockchain programatically and all Steem used to purchase credits should be considered a donation.



**How do I decide on how many Pay Lines to bet?**

The more Pay Lines that you bet on, the higher the chances are that you win (and also, the more you win!) But also, when you lose, you lose more. So betting more pay lines is a high risk/high reward strategy, but you should always find your own play strategy and decide how many pay lines to bet at that time.


**If I bet on more lines, do I increase my chances of winning/How do i set a bet on the slot machine?**

Yes, but you are betting bigger, so you can also lose more.

Clicking the "bet" button will increase the amount of your bet until it reaches the max bet. Clicking the "bet" button while you are at the max bet will start you over from the bottom.


**What if I lose my password/is my personal information safe?**
